            My Trip to Austin, Texas
         </h1>
            <p>
               My friend Michelle and I took a trip to Austin to visit my college roommate, Rebecca. Rebecca moved to Austin to pursue their PhD in Communication at the University of Texas at Austin.

         <h2>
            Day One
         </h2>
            <p>
               We flew out of Kansas City on a direct flight very early in the morning. Since it was my first time flying, we made sure to get to the airport early to walk around. Taking off scared me but the flight was fairly short and I liked it a lot more after we got over 10,000 feet.

               When we landed in Austin, we picked up our rental car and drove by our Airbnb. It was close to Rebecca's apartment, so we said hi to her and then went downtown for lunch and then walked around to kill some time until we could check in. We also went to the grocery store to get some food for the week.

               After checking in and getting settled, Rebecca took us out to dinner at a restaurant called Salsa LÃ­mon, where we had tacos. After, we went to Cidercade, where we played arcade games and had cider. It was on the river, so we were able to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the river at night.

         <h2>
            Day Two
         </h2>
            <p>
               On our second day in Austin, Michelle and I explored S. Congress Ave, which is a popular tourist spot in Austin. It has boot stores, clothes stores, ice cream, and lots of restaurants. After, we visited Rebecca on campus and they showed us around. It was much bigger than the campus where we completed our undergrads, but it was pretty and very busy.

               Later that evening, we took Rebecca out to a nice dinner at Honey Moon Spirit Lounge and after, we went to Amy's for ice cream.

            <h2>
               Day Three
            </h2>
            <p>
               Michelle and I began the day with delicious breakfast tacos at a neighborhood restaurant called Food Heads. After, we went to Wonderspaces. It is a museum with interactive art installations. After, we picked Rebecca up and went to Zilker Metropolitan Park, which ended up being one of our favorite places we visited on the trip.
