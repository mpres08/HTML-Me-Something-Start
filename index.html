            My Trip to Austin, Texas
         </h1>
            <article>
               My friend Michelle and I took a trip to Austin to visit my college roommate, Rebecca. Rebecca moved to Austin to pursue their PhD in Communication at the University of Texas at Austin.

      <h2>
         Day One
      </h2>
         <p>
            We flew out of Kansas City on a direct flight very early in the morning. Since it was my first time flying, we made sure to get to the airport early to walk around. Taking off scared me but the flight was fairly short and I liked it a lot more after we got over 10,000 feet.

            When we landed in Austin, we picked up our rental car and drove by our Airbnb. It was close to Rebecca's apartment, so we said hi to her and then went downtown for lunch and then walked around to kill some time until we could check in. We also went to the grocery store to get some food for the week.
         </p>

         <p>
            After checking in and getting settled, Rebecca took us out to dinner at a restaurant called Salsa Límon, where we had tacos. After, we went to Cidercade, where we played arcade games and had cider. It was on the river, so we were able to sit outside on the patio and enjoy the river at night.
         </p>
      <h2>
         Day Two
      </h2>
         <p>
            On our second day in Austin, Michelle and I explored S. Congress Ave, which is a popular tourist spot in Austin. It has boot stores, clothes stores, ice cream, and lots of restaurants. After, we visited Rebecca on campus and they showed us around. It was much bigger than the campus where we completed our undergrads, but it was pretty and very busy.

            Later that evening, we took Rebecca out to a nice dinner at Honey Moon Spirit Lounge and after, we went to Amy's for ice cream.

            Day Three
         </h2>
            <p>
               Michelle and I began the day with delicious breakfast tacos at a neighborhood restaurant called Food Heads. After, we went to Wonderspaces. It is a museum with interactive art installations. After, we picked Rebecca up and went to Zilker Metropolitan Park, which ended up being one of our favorite places we visited on the trip.
            </p>
            <p>
               We found a trail running along the Colorado River at Zilker and walked until we found a nice spot to sit and watch the kayakers, swimmers, and wildlife enjoy the afternoon on the river.

            <p>
               After an afternoon at the park, we went back to our Airbnb to relax. Later in the evening, we decided we wanted to find a restaurant and have appetizers on a patio for dinner, however, after multiple failed attempts at accomplishing this, we ended up Shake Shack and then played mini golf.
            </p>
         <h2>
            Day Four
         </h2>
            <p>
               On Sunday, we tried to go to Lady Bird Park, which neighbors Zilker, but liked Zilker better, so we moved back there. Later, we went to the Mexic-Arte Museum.
            </p>
            <p>
               For dinner, we picked up Rebecca and went to a restaurant on South Congress and then checked out one of Rebecca's favorite drag bars. After, we hung out with Rebecca at their apartment.

         <h2>
            Day Five
         </h2>
            <p>
               While in Texas, one thing I really wanted to do was horseback riding. Michelle and I both grew up riding horses but do not get the chance to ride any more. We found a ranch just outside Austin to take a trail ride.
            </p>
            <p>
               At the ranch, we met the sweetest cats and goats. The horses we rode were named Dude and Batman. We rode through a stream, cacti patches, and mesquite brush. Our guide told us they had been seeing rattlesnakes on the trail but luckily we did not run into one on our ride.
            </p>

            <p>
               After our trail ride, we went back to our Airbnb to shower and rest a bit before dinner. We loved Salsa Límon so much that we decided we wanted to go back for our final night in Austin. After dinner, we checked out a small, independent bookstore in the neighborhood and sat at the tables outside and read until they closed.

         <h2>
            Day 6
         </h2>
            <p>
               We loved Austin and we were sad to leave, but we were excited to get home to our dogs. We traveled in early March so the weather was perfect for our trip and we were not prepared to go back to Missouri where the weather was still a bit too cool.
